                        <h3>Call of Duty: Warzone</h3>
                        <p>COD Warzone is currently my go-to game at the moment.  It is a battleroyale game type which utilizes all of the familiar Call of Duty play and gun mechanics.  Given it's numerous party size game modes, it's a great time to spend with friends.  I'd highly recommend it to anyone who wants to play a battle royale and enjoys CoD gameplay.</p>
                        <p>Here is an excerpt from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-review">IGN's Review</a> of the game:</p>
                        <p>Like Blackout before it, Warzone’s Verdansk battle royale map mashes up several familiar locations from Call of Duty’s past, albeit on a much larger scale. Verdansk is massive, dwarfing its predecessor and then some. And for a space this vast with a 150-player capacity, Warzone’s performance on PC impressed me as I rarely experienced frame drops or connectivity problems, which feels like a triumph in this context. I did have some trouble with mantling onto ledges in certain areas and the ping system just stops working if you try to use it at too long a range, not to mention that it isn’t nearly as intuitive or robust as the one found in Apex Legends. But these annoyances are very much the exception rather than the rule. You’ll be hard pressed to find an area devoid of well-crafted explorable structures brimming with weapons, supplies, and cash which can be redeemed at randomly placed buy stations for things like killstreaks, armor plates, or weaponry in loadout drops</p>
                        <p>Like the name suggests, the loadout drop lets you equip the guns, gadgets, and perks of your custom Modern Warfare multiplayer loadouts in the middle of a Warzone match. And when I say middle, I really mean beginning. Acquiring the requisite $6,000 to purchase a drop can be done within the first minute of the round if all three players in a squad chip in. While you’ll still need to come by ammo and armor elsewhere, using a loadout drop to scratch two weapons, throwables, and perks off your shopping list in the first 60 seconds of a match is just too easy to make hunting for the randomly placed guns feel worth it.</p>

                        <h3>Metal Gear Solid</h3>
                        <p>Metal Gear Solid is one of my favorite games, and definitely the most memorable playthrough experience. It's a relatively old title in this line-up, but was included for good reason.  It was the first video game that invoked an emotional response from me as a child, with it's cinematic story telling and thorough character development.  It's a stealth / spy type game which had a revolutionionary 3d engine and game mechanics for it's era.</p>
                        <p>Here is an excerpt from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metal-gear-solid-review/1900-2546002/">Gamespots Review</a> of the game from 1998:</p>
                        <p>Metal Gear Solid is the game that has been sending chills down the back of this industry for over two years. Konami leaked bits of information about it here and there, but there was no hiding the notion that Metal Gear Solid would be an adventure of epic proportions. Now, all the waiting has ceased, and the game is finally upon us. But does Metal Gear Solid live up to the years of hype? That really depends on your perspective.</p>
                        <p>At its core, Metal Gear Solid is truly a lesson in stealth. Forget about running into rooms with your gun blazing, leaving nothing alive but an occasional rat. Here, living by the gun readily equates into dying by the gun. Why bother fighting the guards when you can just sneak around behind their backs, crawl along walls just out of the sight range of surveillance cameras, and hide behind boxes?</p>
                        <p>Unlike most other games, Metal Gear Solid really knows how to tell a story. You, as retired supersneaky agent Solid Snake, must infiltrate a base that has been overrun by terrorists. These terrorists, however, are members of your old unit, a top secret organization known as Fox Hound. The hounders are sitting on a supersecret new weapon and enough nuclear warheads to send the planet back to the Ice Age. Your mission (no choice here - you're forced to accept) is to infiltrate the base carrying nothing but a pair of binoculars and a pack of smokes, check up on a couple hostages, find out if Fox Hound even has the ability to carry out its apocalyptic threats, and if it does, stop it. The storyline unfolds in a seemingly never-ending collection of cutscenes, all extremely well rendered using the game engine.</p>

                        <h3>God of War</h3>
                        <p>What a game!  I was not a big fan of the God of War franchise until this gem came out.  The story and focus was respun to focus on scandinavian and viking lore, which I am a personal fan of.  The gameplay mechanics were fun and the cinematography was breathtaking, definitely an easily recommendable game.</p>
                        <p>Here is an excerpt from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/4/12/17226486/god-of-war-review-ps4-2018">Polygon's Review</a> of the game:</p>
                        <p>AboutAbout midway through God of War, Kratos and his son Atreus sit in a canoe in the middle of a lake, listening intently to a disembodied head recount the tawdry and tragic dramas of the Norse gods. The head dishes with the gusto of a gossip columnist and the smoothness of a public radio host. Kratos and son show the orator respect, only interrupting with the occasional question for clarification. That this serene moment doesn’t ring false, let alone veer into tedium, speaks to the tremendous heavy lifting done by the creators of God of War to shift the tone, the style and the expectations of one of the most beloved but also most violent and debaucherous franchises in modern games.</p>
                        <p>Kratos is a parent now, older, calmer and from what I can tell, into the tiny home fad. He’s taken part in an ancient form of witness protection by moving north and living in a modest cabin in the forests of the Norse realm of Midgard. Kratos is, however, no less a magnet for domestic tragedy. His second wife, the mother to his son Atreus, has just died and been cremated. And so, this particular adventure, at the outset at least, has Kratos and his tween on a quest to fulfill her final wish: that her ashes be carried to the highest peak in the realm.</p>

                        <h3>Zelda: Breath of the Wild</h3>
                        <p>I've always been a fan of Zelda games, but the depth and sheer magnitude of things to do in the world of Breath of the Wild is just amazing.  The game is capable of sucking you in for hours with events and actities that aren't remotely related to the main storyline.  It's just that much fun!</p>
                        <p>Here is an excerpt from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review">IGN's Review</a> of the game:</p>
                        <p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild’s sheer freedom and sense of adventure is a remarkable achievement. Right from the start, the vast landscape of Hyrule is thrown completely open to you, and it constantly finds ways to pique your curiosity with mysterious landmarks, complex hidden puzzles, and enemy camps to raid for treasure and weapons. The fact that you can tackle any one of these things at your own pace and almost never get pulled to the main path is liberating, but the way all of Breath of the Wild’s systems fit elegantly into complex light survival game is even more impressive. I’ve been running around for over 50 hours and I still have plenty of mysteries left to track down and lots of wonderfully crafted puzzles to solve. I’m in awe of the scope and scale of this adventure, and I often find myself counting the hours until I can get back in.</p>
                        <p>The untamed, post-apocalyptic, techno-fantasy land of Hyrule is the main character in Breath of the Wild. Not only is it vast, beautiful, and filled with a diverse set of locations from grassy fields to craggy alpine mountains, but it follows surprisingly realistic rules that let you pull off solutions so intuitive that you might be surprised they actually work. The trees bear fruit, grass fields can be set ablaze, and even enemies and animals behave in a believable manner, based on the skittish and aggressive reactions I’ve seen in the wild. But the realistic touches don’t end there. Each object you encounter, from sticks to apples to rocks and metallic blocks, is made of a material, and those materials usually respond to forces like fire and magnetism as you’d expect.</p>
